Disaster Tweets Classification - Deep Learning Mini Project

Project Overview

This project is part of a Kaggle competition: Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets.
The goal is to classify tweets as disaster-related (1) or not disaster-related (0) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

This serves as an introduction to text classification using:

Data preprocessing & cleaning
Text vectorization with TF-IDF
Neural network classification models
Hyperparameter tuning
